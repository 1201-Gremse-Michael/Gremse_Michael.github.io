Changes made to the game:

added a lives counter that actively tracks when the player collides with a creep.

added a HUD element to display current amount of lives and updates accordingly with the game

added a title to the score HUD element so its not just a floating number with no context

gave the player 2 seconds of immunity frames after colliding with a creep to prevent insta-death
